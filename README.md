## Installation

First the user must use a code editor to begin, a code editor that I recommend using which is practial is VS Code. Once the code editor is installed the next component is to install node.js which allows us to use a open library within our code to ensure a smooth process when building the application. Now the last step to follow is to copy the github repo which will be linked here [https://github.com/Innovative-J/Note-taker-.git]. Now within the code editor the clone the repo using git clone followed by the link will allow you to have full functionally of the application.
